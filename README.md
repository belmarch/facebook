Return of Facebook 
========
See below for original Facebook assignment.

The purpose of this homework is to leverage animations and gestures to transition between screens. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement some interactions in Facebook.

Time spent: 10 hours

Completed user stories:
* Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
* Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
* On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
* If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.

Notes: Hacks a plenty. Among other things, couldn't figure out how to use the frame variable and couldn't get image views to hide during animation.

Facebook
========

This is a demo of basic Facebook navigation.

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

* Required: User can tab through 5 view controllers
* Required: User can scroll through content within each view controller
* Required: User can open Thrillist post, scroll through post, and like post
* Required: User can open and close Status, Photo, and Check In modals

Notes:

Spent way too much time trying to figure out the bonus story (animating text over the keyboard). Build kept getting corrupted after each try which forced me to redo the view controller a few times.
