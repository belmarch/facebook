Facebook
========

This is a demo of basic Facebook navigation.

Time spent: 15 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

* Required: User can tab through 5 view controllers
* Required: User can scroll through content within each view controller
* Required: User can open Thrillist post, scroll through post, and like post
* Required: User can open and close Status, Photo, and Check In modals

Notes:

Spent way too much time trying to figure out the bonus story (animating text over the keyboard). Build kept getting corrupted after each try which forced me to redo the view controller a few times.
